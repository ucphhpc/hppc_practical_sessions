# HPPC Practical on Hackpad

Welcome to the online pratical session for High Parallel Performance Computing.

## How does this work?

If you have questions about the exercises or the assignments you can ask them in one of the following ways:

- In one of the provided question sections below.
- As a discussion on Absalon.
- Send a private message to me on Absalon or @ rasmus.munk@nbi.ku.dk.
- You can also request a video conference or screen sharing via Zoom @ https://deic.zoom.us/.


To ask a question below, you first need to be authenticated @ https://hackmd.io/login.

Afterwards you can edit this document by switching either to the "Edit" or "Both" viewing mode by selecting your chosen option at the left hand side of the menu bar.

A general recommendation is to use the code `</>` block formatting when you want to ask a question about a specific piece of code. Also to add syntax color highlighting, add cpp to the start of the code block:

\`\`\`cpp


\`\`\`

*For Example:*

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello from Hackpad with syntax color highlights" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
